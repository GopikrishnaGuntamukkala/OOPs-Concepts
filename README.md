# OOPs Concepts in Python

This repository explores the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on the four basic principles or pillars.

## 4 Basics of OOP

1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It helps in controlling access to the data and preventing unintended interference.

2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It allows developers to focus on the relevant aspects of an object and ignore unnecessary details.

3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between a base class (parent) and a derived class (child).

4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. This simplifies code and enhances flexibility. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
